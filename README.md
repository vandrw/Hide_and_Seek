# Hide and Seek
This project creates a competitive multi-agent environment, where 2 players in each team act on a 32x32 grid.

## To Do
* Implement a field of view for the seeker (and possibly the hider)
* look around (explore), move (exploit)
* Have the seeker and the hider spawn at a random position, with a distance higher than the vision range
* if seeker finds hider, rush back to start
* increase maze + default base
* see first reward in front (exploit by going forward)

## How to Run
To run the code, go to a terminal, set the present working directory as K-armed_Bandits and run the following commands:

```
make
make run
```
