# Hide and Seek
This project creates a competitive multi-agent environment, where 2 players in each team act on a 32x32 grid.

## To Do
- [x] Implement a field of view for the seeker (and possibly the hider)
- [x] look around (explore), move (exploit)
- [x] Have the seeker and the hider spawn at a random position, with a distance higher than the vision range
- [x] if seeker finds hider, rush back to stat
- [ ] increase maze 
- [x] see first reward in front (exploit by going forward)
- [ ] hider gets the go-to-base reward from the beginning

## How to Run
