# Hide and Seek
This project creates a competitive multi-agent environment, where 2 players in each team act on a 32x32 grid.

## To Do
- [x] Implement a field of view for the seeker (and possibly the hider)
- [x] look around (explore), move (exploit)
- [x] Have the seeker and the hider spawn at a random position, with a distance higher than the vision range
- [x] if seeker finds hider, rush back to start
- [ ] increase maze 
- [x] see first reward in front (exploit by going forward)
- [x] prints to file rewards for each agent per turn, winner of a game, end turn, turn when hider is found
- [ ] hider gets the go-to-base reward from the beginning (? mayyybe)
- [ ] print average reward per turn over multiple games for each agent
- [ ] prints how many times each agent (type) won
- [ ] prints end turn for every game & turn when hider was found
